# Rag-using-Langchain-with-Cohere-reranker-Retrival:BM25-and-Zypher7B
The notebook uses langchain to split into sentences , FAISS Vector DB is used to store embeddings ehich are generated by Embedding model BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 , Then BM25 is used for enseble retrieval. Cohere reranker is used with compression techniques and lastly llm Zypher 7B is used for generation
Multiple reranker models used including Maximal Marginal Relevance
